# Awesome I2P

A curated list of awesome I2P implementations, libraries, resources, projects, and shiny things. Inspired by [awesome-tor](https://github.com/ajvb/awesome-tor) and [awesome-cpp](https://github.com/fffaraz/awesome-cpp) and other awesome lists.

### What is I2P?
I2P is an anonymous overlay network - a network within a network. It is intended to protect communication from dragnet surveillance and monitoring by third parties such as ISPs.
I2P is used by many people who care about their privacy: activists, oppressed people, journalists and whistleblowers, as well as the average person.
