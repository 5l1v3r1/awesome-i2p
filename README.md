# Awesome I2P

A curated list of awesome I2P implementations, libraries, resources, projects, and shiny things. Inspired by [awesome-tor](https://github.com/ajvb/awesome-tor) and [awesome-cpp](https://github.com/fffaraz/awesome-cpp) and other awesome lists.

### What is I2P?
I2P is an anonymous overlay network - a network within a network. It is intended to protect communication from dragnet surveillance and monitoring by third parties such as ISPs.
I2P is used by many people who care about their privacy: activists, oppressed people, journalists and whistleblowers, as well as the average person.

## The I2P Project

#### [geti2p.net](http://geti2p.net/)
#### [i2pforum.net](https://i2pforum.net/)

## Implementations

### I2P
* [I2P](https://github.com/i2p/i2p.i2p) - The first implementation. Written in Java.
* [I2P Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.i2p.android) - Android release of the I2P router. (Google play)
* [I2P Android](https://f-droid.org/packages/net.i2p.android.router/) - Android release of the I2P router. (F-Droid)

### I2Pd
* [I2Pd](https://github.com/PurpleI2P/i2pd) - A C++ implementation of a I2P router.
* [Kovri](https://github.com/monero-project/kovri) - The Kovri I2P Router Project, a fork of I2Pd by the Monero project.

## Projects using I2P

* [I2P-Bote](https://i2pbote.xyz/) - I2P-Bote is a plugin for I2P that allows users to send and receive emails while preserving privacy. It does not need a mail server because emails are stored in a distributed hash table. They are automatically encrypted and digitally signed, which ensures no one but the intended recipient can read the email, and third parties cannot forge them.
* [I2P-Bote Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=i2p.bote.android) - Android release of I2P-Bote. (Google Play)
* [Syndie](https://github.com/i2p/i2p.syndie) - Syndie is an open source system for operating distributed forums, offering a secure and consistent interface to various anonymous and non-anonymous content networks.
* [Anoncoin](https://anoncoin.net/) - The Anoncoin project.
* [Monero](https://getmonero.org/) - Monero is a secure, private, and untraceable cryptocurrency. It is open-source and accessible to all. With Monero, you are your own bank. Only you control and are responsible for your funds. Your accounts and transactions are kept private from prying eyes.
* [GOSTCoin](https://github.com/GOSTSec/gostcoin) - GOSTCoin (GST) is a digital currency based on blockchain technology. It allows instant payments worldwide with focus on privacy and security of its users.
* [Transmission-I2P](https://github.com/l-n-s/transmission-i2p) - Anonymous torrent client Transmission-I2P.

## Tools

* [i2p-tools](https://github.com/MDrollette/i2p-tools) - This tool provides a secure and efficient reseed server for the I2P network. There are several utility commands to create, sign, and validate SU3 files.
* [I2PMonitor](https://github.com/miximka/I2PMonitor) - I2P monitor and control application for Mac OS X.
* [i2spy](https://github.com/chris-barry/i2spy) - Takes stats from many i2p nodes, and holds them in a centralized location.
* [i2pjump](https://github.com/robertfoss/i2pjump) - I2P jump service. A sort of slave DNS server for I2P.

## Libraries

* [node-i2p](https://github.com/redhog/node-i2p) - NodeJS api for communicating over i2p (SAMv3 client).
* [libsam3](https://github.com/i2p/libsam3) - C SAMv3 library.
* [txi2p](https://github.com/str4d/txi2p) - I2P bindings for Twisted.
* [i2p.rb](https://github.com/dryruby/i2p.rb) - I2P.rb is a Ruby library for interacting with the I2P anonymity network (last update 2010).

## Unfinished implementations

* [go-i2p](https://github.com/hkparker/go-i2p) - A pure Go implementation of the I2P router.
* [i2p-cs](https://github.com/PeterZander/i2p-cs) - I2P router in C#.
